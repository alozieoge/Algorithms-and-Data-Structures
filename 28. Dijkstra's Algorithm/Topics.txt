5. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a Binary Heap Priority Queue.

What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?
- It finds the shortest path between 2 vertices / nodes in a weighted graph
- Answers the question "What is the fastest way to go from point A to point B?"
- Developed by Edsger Dijkstra (Dutch)

Importance of Dijktra's algorithm
- GPS: Find fastest route. 
- Network routing: Find open shortest path for data transfer. 
- Biology: Model the spread of viruses among humans. 
- Airlinr tickets: Find cheapest route to a destination. 
...

Weighted Graph Class
In a weighted graph, each edge has an associated number / value representing the distance between the connected vertices / nodes.
