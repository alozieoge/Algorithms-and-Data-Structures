Why learn sorting
1. Sorting is an incredibly common task; good to know how it works. 
2. There are many different ways to sort things, each with their advantages and disadvantages. 
3. Technical interviews.

Objectives:
- Implement bubble sort. 
- Implement selection sort
- Implement insertion sort.
- Compare above sorting algorithms.

Built-in Javascript Sorting
- JS default `Array.sort()` method sorts according to each element's Unicode code-point value, according to the string equivalent of each element. 

- You can customize how it works by providing an additional (optional) comparator function as an argument to the sort() method. 
- The comparator looks at pairs of eleents (a, b) and determines their sort order based on the return value. 
  - If it returns a -ve number, a should come before b.
  - If it returns a +ve number, a should come after b. 
  - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned.
