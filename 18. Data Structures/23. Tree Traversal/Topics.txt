Q. How do we visit (store the value) every node in a tree only once?
A. They are many ways to ado this.

2 Main Approaches
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
   a. PreOrder
   b. PostOrder
   c. InOrder
   
Example Tree:
     10
    /  \
   6    15
 /   \    \
3     8    20

1. BFS 
- Iteratively: 
  - Visit every sibling node
  - Traverse to the child node
>> [10, 6, 15, 3, 8, 20]


2. DFS
- Vist and traverse nodes vertically. 
- The order of visiting nodes (storing node values) will determine the sequence of result array.

a. PreOrder:
- Recursively: (Node->Left->Right)
  - Visit each node
  - Traverse left branch
  - Traverse right branch
>> [10, 6, 3, 8, 15, 20]

b. PostOrder:
- Recursively: (Left->Right->Node)
  - Traverse left branch
  - Traverse right branch
  - Visit each node
>> [3, 8, 6, 20, 15, 10]

c. InOrder:
- Recursively: (Left->Node->Right)
  - Traverse left branch
  - Visit each node
  - Traverse right branch
>> [3, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20]
