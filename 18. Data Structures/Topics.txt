Data structures are collections of values, containing the relationships between these values and functions / operations that can be applied to them.

Data Structures
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary heap
- Trees
- Graphs

WHy so many?
- Different data structures excel at different things. 
- Some are highly specialised while others are commonly used e.g. arrays, objects.

Why care?
- Need to handle more specialized, complex data.
- Potentially worked with some of them.
- Technical interviews.


ES2015 Class Syntax
- Javascript is not originally an OOP language, but since ES2015, the `class` keyword was introduced to support OOP implementation.

- A class is a blueprint / template for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods. 
- JS classes are built on prototypes, which inherit properties and methods from the Obect prototype.
- JS prototypes allow you to add new properties and methods to already defined class constructors.

Why classes?
- We need to implement data structures as classes.

Class instances
- Instantiate objects from the class using the `new` keyword.

Instance methods
- Provide functionality for a specific instance of a class / object.
- Best practise: Use instance methods to modify clss instance properties.

Class methods
- Provide utility / overall functionality for the class, but not necessarily to individual instances of the class.
- Preceeded with the `static` keyword.
