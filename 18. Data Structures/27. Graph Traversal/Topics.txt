Graph traversal = visiting / updating / checking each node in a graph.

Applications
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Web crawlers
- Finding closest match / recommendation
- Shortest path problem
  - GPS naviation
  - Solving mazes
  - AI (shortest path to win a game)
  

1. Depth First Traversal
- Explore as far as possible down one branch before 'backtracking'.
  - Prioritize visiting adjacent vertices to a node/vertex before sibling nodes/vertices.
- Can be implemented recursively or iteratively.
