Objectives:
- What is a Doubly Linked List.
- Construct a Doubly Linked List.
- Compare and contrast Doubly and Singly Linked Lists.
- Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List.

1. What is a Doubly-Linked List
- It is identical to a Singly-Linked List, except each node has another pointer, to the previous node.


2. DLL vs SLL
- DLL provides more flexibility in certain linked list operations e.g. popping, reversing.
- However, additional code / complexity is required to account for 'previous' referencing in DLL. 
- DLL also requires more memory for storage due to additional information encoded.


3. DLL class and methods
- The node class has 3 properties:
  - value: node value.
  - next: pointer to the next node.
  - prev: pointer to the previous node.

- The DLL class has 3 properties:
  - head: beginning of the DLL.
  - tail: end of the DLL.
  - length: length of the DLL.
  
  
4. DLL Operations

a. Push(value)
- Adds a new node to the end of the DLL.
- This new node becomes the tail.

b. Pop()
- Removes the node at the end of the DLL. 
- The 2nd last node becomes the tail. 
- Make sure to remove the `prev` pointer of the removed tail node to prevent ghost pointers in your code.

c. Shift()
- Removes a new node from the beginning of the DLL.
- Similar to SLL, but also updating the `prev` pointer.
- If the initial DLL length is 1, shift() is similar to pop().

d. Unshift(value)
- Adds a new node to the beginning of the DLL. 
- Similar to SLL, but also updating the `prev` pointer.
- If the initial DLL length is 0, unshift() is similar to push().

e. Get(index)
- Accesses a node in the DLL by its position. 
- Similar to SLL but can be optimized by starting traversal from either the head or the tail node, depending on which is closer to the index / position.

f. Set(index, value)
- Replaces the value of a node at a position in the DLL> 
- Uses the get() method to optimize traversal and return the node to be updated.

g. Insert(index, value)
- Adds a new node to the DLL at a certain position. 
- Uses the get() method.
- Requires the next and prev properties to be updated.

h. Remove(index)
- Removes a node in a DLL at a certain position. 
- Uses the get() method. 

i. Print() 
- Prints the node values of the DLL to the console.
