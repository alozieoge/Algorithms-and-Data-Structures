Objectives
1. What is an algorithm?
2. Plan / approach to solve algorithms. 
3. Compare and contrast problem solving patterns e.g. frequency counters, 2 pointer problems, divide and conquer.

A. Algorithm
- An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 

Why do we need to know algorithms. 
- Everything we do in programming involves some algorithm
- Foundation for successful developer and problem solver
- Technical interviews

How to improve
1. Devise a plan for solving problems. 
2. Master common problem-solving patterns. 

Problem Solving Strategies
1. Understand the problem. 
2. Explore concrete examples.
3. Break it down. 
4. Solve / simplify.
5. Look back and refactor.
